# About VPN :
-   VPN or Virtual Private Network allows you to add another layer of security over the application which can restrict the public internet to access your application. In this way, individuals or groups with the correct authentication can only connect to VPN and use this application.
-   VPNs are usually used within an organization to add another layer of security
-   The following steps can be configured to require a VPN connection -> 
    1.  upload images 
    2.  start the process 
    3.  track the progress of the process 
    4.  access the google Map overlay
-   The servers and website will be hosted in a private network so VPN will be required to access these URLs.

## How to Connect
Download one of the following softwares:
-   OpenVPN Connect for Windows/Mac - https://openvpn.net/client-connect-vpn-for-windows/
-   TunnelBlick for Mac - https://tunnelblick.net/downloads.html
If using OpenVPN - Click on import profile using file and import the VPN connection ‘XXXX-config.ovpn’ key. **(this key will be generated by you through your deployment.)**
For Tunnelblick - Click on configurations icon at the top. Then drag and drop the ‘XXXX-config.ovpn’ key to the configurations tab on the left.
Once done, the configuration will be saved and just connecting to the saved profile/configuration directly from the next time would suffice.
Disconnect from the VPN once you’re done running the process and/or done accessing the URL endpoints.
